        <p style="font-size: 50px;">The risk of worker exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), depends on numerous factors, including the extent of community transmission; the severity of resulting illness; existing medical conditions workers may have; environmental conditions that may affect exposure risk (e.g., working or living in close quarters); and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus and the relative success of these measures. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides detailed information about this topic.

            Certain people are at higher risk of developing more serious complications from COVID-19, including older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as heart or lung disease, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, liver disease, diabetes, immune deficiencies, or obesity. See CDC's page for additional information about health conditions that put individuals at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19.

            Classifying Risk of Worker Exposure to SARS-CoV-2
            Worker risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic may vary from community to community, depending on local conditions or outbreaks. Exposure risk depends in part on the physical environment of the workplace, the type of work activity, the health status of the worker, the ability of workers to wear face coverings and abide by CDC guidelines, and the need for close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with other people, including those known to have or suspected of having COVID-19, and those who may be infected with—and able to spread—SARS-CoV-2 without knowing it. Other factors, such as conditions in communities where employees live and work, their activities outside of work, and individual health conditions, may also affect workers’ risk of getting COVID-19 and/or developing complications from the illness. </p>
