        <p style="font-size: 50px;">People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported â€“ ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
            Fever or chills
            Cough
            Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
            Fatigue
            Muscle or body aches
            Headache
            New loss of taste or smell
            Sore throat
            Congestion or runny nose

            This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.
